Simple flow for cloning and adding one file from working folder to the git remote repository (in GitBash):

// Open GitBash

$ cd ~/Desctop/sda/trainer 
$ pwd
/c/Users/danrusu/Desktop/sda/trainer

$ git clone https://github.com/danrusu/sda-test-tim1.git
$ cd sda-test-tim1
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

$ touch newFile.txt
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        newFile.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

$ git add -A
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   newFile.txt

$ git commit -m "added newFile for testing purpose"
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean

$ git push
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
